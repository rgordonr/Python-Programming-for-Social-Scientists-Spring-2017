# Python Programming for Social Scientists (Spring 2017)

This will be a three- or four-part workshop geared towards graduate students who wish to learn how they can utilize Python in their research. My main goal is for students to come away from this workshop being able to integrate Python into their existing workflow involving traditional data-analysis software (e.g., STATA and SPSS). Why add Python? Proficiency with Python allows for relatively simple automation of complex tasks; access to a massive library of freely available, well-documented software; and access to popular APIs from Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, and many other sources. 

Although we will only cover the basics of Python, this course should provide a solid foundation from which you can pursue further experience. One of the key strengths of Python is it's popularity and community; you can find a solution to nearly any problem you encounter through a quick Google search.

This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of programming in the Python language, with an emphasis on: 

 * reading and writing data to CSV files
 * finding, downloading, importing, and using existing libraries of code 
 * possibly extracting data from APIs, but this may change depending on students' interests

This workshop will have in-class exercises but no grades or required homework. Each day will be roughly an hour and a half long, and classes will be held on a bi-weekly basis. The exact time will be adjusted to best fit everyone's schedules.

This workshop is targeted at graduate students with little to no programming experience.
