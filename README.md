# Python Programming for Social Scientists (Spring 2017)

This will be a four-part workshop geared towards graduate students who wish to learn how they can utilize python in their research. My main goal is for students to come away from this workshop being able to integrate python into their existing workflow involving traditional data-analysis software (e.g., STATA and SPSS). Why add Python? Proficiency with Python allows for relatively simple automation of complex tasks; access to a massive library of freely available, well-documented software; and access to popular APIs from Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, and many other sources. Although we will only cover the basics of python, this course should provide a solid foundation from which you can pursue further experience.

This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of programming in the Python language, with an emphasis on: 

 * reading from CSV files and writing data to CSV files in ways that can be easily analyzed
 * finding, downloading, importing, and using existing libraries of code 
 * possibly extracting data from APIs, but this may depend on how quickly we get through other topics

This workshop will have in-class exercises but no grades or required homework. Each class will be roughly an hour and a half long, and classes will be held on a bi-weekly basis (i.e. twice a month). The exact time will be adjusted to best fit everyone's schedules. The content I hope to cover in our first class can be found here: [Day One.ipynb](https://github.com/rgordonr/Python-Programming-for-Social-Scientists-Spring-2017/blob/master/Day%20One.ipynb).

This workshop is targeted at graduate students with little to no programming experience. If you are already proficient at using R, this course may not provide you with many new skills, appart from an ability to pursue more advanced python topics.
